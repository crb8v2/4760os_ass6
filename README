THIS PROJECT:
	This is an example of Memory Management making requests between a page table and frame table. 
	Termination occurs after all processes (max 18) have ran for a discrete amount of time.
	If frames are not in the page table, a page fault occurs.
	If there is a frame in the page table, the request is granted.
	If the the frame table is full, the second change algorithm is implemented.
